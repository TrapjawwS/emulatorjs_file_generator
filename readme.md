Just download the index.html file and run it from your file manager. If you would like to add more games yourself, fork the repository, go into index.html and modify the link for the external script source, and then go to script.js and add all the games you would ever want. (currently it only runs gba, gbc, and gb games. If you want to run games from other consoles, you're going to have to make some modificatons your self) 

By the way, I did not code the pokedex. If you want the source code to the pokedex, here's the link: https://github.com/davidhckh/pokedex
